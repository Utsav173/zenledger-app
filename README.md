# ZenLedger Public Site

**DO NOT EDIT THIS FOLDER DIRECTLY.**

This directory (`public-site/`) is a **generated artifact**. It contains the static landing page and assets deployed to [zenledger.khatriutsav.com](https://zenledger.khatriutsav.com).

## How to Update

1.  **Edit Source**: Make changes in `docs/LANDING_PAGE.html` or `docs/*.md`.
2.  **Sync**: Run `bun public:sync` from the project root. This effectively "builds" this folder.
3.  **Deploy**: Run `bun public:deploy` to push to Cloudflare Pages.

## Deployment Details

- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Domain**: `zenledger.khatriutsav.com`
- **APK Limits**: The `deploy:public` script automatically excludes the 35MB+ APK file during upload to bypass Cloudflare's 25MB limit. The download links on the site point to GitHub Releases instead.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main landing page (generated from `docs/LANDING_PAGE.html`).
- `manual/`: User documentation (synced from `docs/`).
- `download/`: Contains the APK (for GitHub storage only, ignored by Cloudflare).
- `robots.txt` / `sitemap.xml`: SEO files.
